A website dedicated for my sister's birthday!

Features of the website:
1) A welcoming page before visiting the main page
2) Confetti on the welcoming page 
3) Background music (Ed Sheeran's Perfect on the piano!) on the main page
4) A custom designed carousel that hosts high quality pictures
5) Message conveyed through beautiful font on a background image of roses
